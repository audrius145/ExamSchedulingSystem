                <p>Exams take place according to the examination plans posted on Studynet by the Study Administration no later than December 1 (winter exams) and May 1 (summer exams). It is important that you keep up to date with the exam plans, as changes may occur. Changes which are made before the exam period has started will NOT be communicated directly to you. Remember therefore to check Studynet regularly, as exams may be rescheduled not only to a later date, but also to an earlier date. Any changes made during the 3-week exam period, will be sent to your VIA mail. If the same oral exam is conducted over several days, and the day which you are scheduled for coincides with one of your other exams, it is your own responsibility to inform your lecturer about preferred day of examination. Show up in good time before the examination starts. Please note that oral exams and project exams may start earlier than 08h00. </p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="b">Before the exam</h4>
                <p>You need to show up in good time, so you can be ready and have all your IT equipment in place at least 15 minutes before the exam begins. Remember to bring your VIA ID Card or similar ID with your photo on. Before the examination begins, you need to identify yourself, so the exam invigilators may register your attendance. You are not permitted to sit for the exam if you haven’t identified yourself to the exam invigilators. Bring your own computer, power supply, extension cord and an empty USB stick so you can make regular back-up copies of your work. VIA does not provide a computer for you. If you are late, you may only enter the exam room and participate in the exam if the exam invigilator gives permission. If you are more than 10 minutes late, you must go to the Study Administration. The Study Administration will decide, where relevant in cooperation with the lecturer or Head of Programme, if you will be allowed to participate in the exam. You are only permitted to participate in the exam, if VIA finds it impossible that you may have received knowledge about the exam assignment, and that the reason for your delay is fair. Before the exam begins, the exam invigilators will give oral directions. The exam assignment will be distributed digitally in WISEflow where it will be available and ready for download when the exam begins. The exam assignment will only be distributed in printed form by the exam invigilators in special instances – e.g. if the exam is conducted without means of aid or if answers need to be written directly on the exam assignment. If the exam is conducted on paper, all necessary paper will be handed out to you. If you need more paper, contact the exam invigilator by raising your hand.</p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="c">During the exam</h4>
                <p>During the exam, the exam invigilator may be contacted by raising your hand. Please note that the exam invigilator is not allowed to answer any questions regarding the assignment, your exam paper or the grading. You may only leave the examination room when accompanied by an exam invigilator. When you need to go to the toilet, you must use the toilet advised to you by the exam invigilator. You are not allowed to go outside, to the canteen or any other places. Smoking is not allowed. Mobile phones are not allowed. If you bring a mobile phone, you must turn it off and hand it over to the exam invigilator before the exam begins. iPods and other music players may not be used during the exam and must be handed over to the exam invigilator. You are not allowed to exchange information with or in any way be in contact with other examinees or persons outside the examination room. All communications and file sharing services (email, Messenger, Skype, Dropbox, Facebook, etc.), MUST be switched off during the exam. There must be complete silence the last 30 minutes of the exam. This means that you are not allowed to hand in your exam paper, pack your things or leave the room before the exam has ended. If you display disturbing behavior, VIA has the authority to remove you from the exam. </p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="d">Means of aid</h4>
                <p>The course description, curriculum or exam assignment will state which aids you should bring and any aids that are not allowed. This includes the use of own computer and whether use of internet is permitted or not. Access to the internet is always permitted in order to use WISEflow for download of the exam assignment and submission of your exam paper. It is not permitted to borrow means of aid from other examinees. </p>
                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="e">Handing in on paper</h4>
                <p>Remember to write your name, student number, date, page numbers and course on the cover sheet including all sheets of the paper. You may only use a blue or a black pen. You are not allowed to use red writing on your exam paper, as red is for corrections made by the examiner. You are not allowed to use pencil. If you hand in on paper only, you don’t need to do anything in WISEflow. </p>
                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="f">Digital Submission in WISEflow</h4>
                <p>Your exam paper must be converted to PDF format before submission. If you have several PDF files these must be merged into one PDF file and submitted under “Paper” in WISEflow. If PDF format is not at all possible, other file formats may be submitted as Appendix Material. Zipped files can only be submitted as Appendix Material. It is not allowed to use WinRAR format. Be careful, when you submit your exam paper, so you don’t submit the wrong file by mistake. The consequence being that your exam paper will not be assessed and you will have used one exam attempt. Remember to write your name, student number and page numbers on all pages. WISEflow guidelines can be found on Studynet. Please read the guidelines well before the exam. You may also contact the Study Administration if you have further questions. </p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 " id="g">Concluson of the Exam and Hand in</h4>
                <p>The exam invigilators will announce when there is 30 minutes remaining of the exam.
                    <br>Options at written exams on campus: Unless it is stipulated otherwise in the curriculum, course description or exam assignment, you may choose between the following ways of handing in your exam paper:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>handwritten</li>
                    <li>digitally in WISEflow</li>
                    <li>a combination of handwritten material and digital submission in WISEflow</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If part of the exam paper needs to be handed in separately, it will appear from the exam assignment. If a cover sheet in paper is distributed to you at the beginning of the exam, this has to be filled in. Please state on the cover sheet how you have handed in your paper: handwritten, digitally or a combination. The cover sheet has to be signed by you to confirm that the paper is made without unduly help. If the exam is conducted 100% in WISEflow, a cover sheet in paper is not needed. Instead you need to fill in a digital cover sheet and a solemn declaration in WISEflow before you can submit your exam paper. Handwritten exam papers may not be handed in during the last 30 minutes of the exam. You are permitted to submit your paper in WISEflow during the last 30 minutes, but there must be complete silence during the remaining time of the exam and therefore you are not allowed to hand in any written material, pack your things or leave the examination room. When handing in after the exam has ended everyone must remain seated without talking until the invigilator has collected all exam papers. You are responsible for handing in everything in the relevant covers or in WISEflow. It is optional if you wish to hand in any drafts. If you haven’t finished your exam paper, you may hand in drafts and notes, if you notify it when handing in. The external examiner decides if the drafts and notes will be part of the assessment. You are allowed to take the exam assignment with you if you leave, when the exam has ended (but not if you leave before the exam finishes). If you wish to hand in your exam paper, before the exam finishes, you need to contact the exam invigilator. If you leave the exam, before it finishes, you are not allowed to bring your computer, mobile phone, exam paper or anything else with you. You have to come back and collect your things, when the exam has ended. Please leave the examination room in a quiet manner so that students with extended test time will not be disturbed.</p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 ">Specific Rules regarding Digital Exam and the Use of Computer</h4>
                <p>It is your own responsibility that your computer works and that you know how to use the relevant programs. VIA does not provide spare computers. If your exam is conducted digitally, we recommend that you try the demo-flow in WISEflow well before the exam. The computer must be silent (beeps and others sounds turned off). It is permitted to bring an extra screen or tablet if needed. Remember to bring an empty USB stick and make sure that back-up copies of your work are made regularly and saved on your hard drive and USB stick. In case of network failure or similar, the back-up copies are your only way to document your work. If problems arise with your computer, that you cannot resolve yourself, you can get help from IT support by contacting the invigilator. If the problems still cannot be resolved, you may continue the exam with pen and paper. Remember therefore to bring writing utensils just in case. If a power failure, network outage or other external issue affecting the use of IT equipment occur and cannot be resolved, the invigilator contacts the Study Administration who will confer with the lecturer/exam supervisor about the continuation of the exam. </p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 ">Illness Before or During the Exam</h4>
                <p>If you fall ill before an exam, you must immediately inform the Study Administration and consult a doctor in order to provide documentation of the illness. If you fall ill during the exam and have to leave, you must contact the exam invigilator. The exam invigilator will note down that you have left the exam at x o’clock due to illness. You must consult a doctor – at the latest on the day of the exam – in order to provide documentation of the illness, which is to be sent to the Study Administration no later than 5 weekdays after the examination. You have to cover any expenses in this connection. If you are unable to document your illness, it will count as 1 exam attempt. If you experience a serious incident which prevents you from participating in the exam, you must inform the Study Administration as soon as possible. The Study Administration, where relevant in cooperation with the lecturer, student counsellor or Head of Programme, will assess if the rules for illness can also apply for this incident. If this is the case, the exam attempt will not count. In many programmes, re-exams and make-up exams are conducted in the following exam period, unless the exam is in the last semester of the study programme. </p>

                <h4 class="rounded text-center my-4 py-2 ">Cheating in Exams</h4>
                <p>If you receive or give another examinee unduly help during the exam, or make use of means of aid other than permitted, you will be suspended from the exam and have used 1 examination attempt. If doubt is raised – during or after the exam – that you unduly have received or given help, or have submitted an exam paper made by someone else, or the like, it will be reported to VIA. More information about sanctions and penalties due to cheating and plagiarism may be found in the curriculum of your study programme. </p>
